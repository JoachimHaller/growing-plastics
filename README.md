# growing-plastics
The software that control the design of what can only be described as a carpet that i laid out on barren land.
The carpet is made of discarded plastics and consists of hexagonal compartments.
The there are 4 or maybe 5 types of hexagonal compartments
Type one is a water compartment
Type two is a soil with seed compartment
Type three is an empty compartment, roof only
Type four is a hollow compartment
There might be reason to have a type five cpompartment with floor only
The intention is to create moist micro climate for the seeds to grow and small animals to live
Growth dependent on how much water that can be captured from ground and air
